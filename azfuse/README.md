# AzFuse

AzFuse is a lightweight [blobfuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse)-like
python tool with the data transfer
implemented through [AzCopy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy).
With this tool, reading/writing a file in azure storage is similar to reading a local
file, which follows the same principle of blobfuse. However, the underlying data
transfer is to leverage azcopy, which provides a much faster speed. 

## Installation
1. Download azcopy from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10).
   Copy azcopy as `~/code/azcopy/azcopy` or under `/usr/bin/` and
   make it executable.  Make sure it is version 10 or higher.
2. install by
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/azfuse.git
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/azfuse.git
   cd azfuse
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Preliminary
Azfuse contains 3 different kinds of file paths.
1. `local` or `logical` path, which is populated by the user script. For example, the user
   script may want to access the file, named `data/abc.txt`, which is referred
   to as
   `local` path.
2. `remote` path, which is the path in azure
   storage blob. For example, if the azure storage path is 
   `https://accountname.blob.core.windows.net/containername/path/data/abc.txt`, the
   `remote` path will be `path/data/abc.txt`. Note that, the remote path does not
   include the `containername` in the url.
3. `cache` path, which is the destination file of the azcopy, e.g. `/tmp/data/abc.txt`. We will use azcopy to download the file here or upload this file to Azure.

The pipeline is
1. the user script tries to access `data/abc.txt` through `with azfuse.File.open()`.
2. if it is in read mode, the tool will check if the `cache` path exists.
    - if it exists, it returns the handle of the `cache` file
    - if it does not exist, it will download the file from `remote` path to
      `cache` path and return the handle of the `cache` file.
3. if it is in write mode, the tool will open the `cache` path, and return the
   handle of the `cache` path. Before leaving `with`, the tool will upload the
   `cache` file to `remote` file.

## Setup
1. By default, the feature is disabled. That is, the file read/write will
   directly access the `local` file without trying to access the `remote` in
   azure blob. Thus, it is also recommended to first use such tool, but not
   to enable it (also, no need to configure it).
   To enable it, set `AZFUSE_USE_FUSE=1` explicitly. The following describes
   how to configure it when enabled.
2. Set the environment variable of `AZFUSE_CLOUD_FUSE_CONFIG_FILE` as the
   configuration file path, e.g. `AZFUSE_CLOUD_FUSE_CONFIG_FILE=./aux_data/configs/azfuse.yaml`
3. The configuration file is in yaml format, and is a list of dictionary. Each
   dictionary contains `local`, `remote`, `cache`, and `storage_account`.
   ```yaml
   - cache: /tmp/azfuse/data
     local: data
     remote: azfuse_data
     storage_account: storage_config_name
   - cache: /tmp/azfuse/models
     local: models
     remote: models
     storage_account: storage_config_name
   ```
   The path in the yaml file is the prefix of the corresponding path. For example, if the
   local path is `data/abc.txt`, the `cache` path will be
   `/tmp/azfuse/data/abc.txt`, and the `remote` path will be
   `azfuse_data/abc.txt`. The tool will match each prefix from the first to the
   last, and the one which is matched first will be the one used. If there is
   no match, it will assume this is a local file, which can also be a blobfuse
   mount file.

   The storage account here is the base file name. Here, the path will be
   `./aux_data/storage_account/storage_config_name.yaml`. The folder can be
   changed by setting `AZFUSE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONFIG_FOLDER`. The storage
   account yaml file's format should be like this
   ```yaml
   account_name: accountname
   account_key: accountkey
   sas_token: sastoken
   container_name: containername
   ```
   `account_key` or `sas_token` can be `null`. The `sas_token` should start with
   `?`.

## Examples
- Open a file to read
  ```python
  from azfuse import File
  with File.open('data/abc.txt', 'r') as fp:
      content = fp.read()
  ```
  It will match the prefix of `local` path in the configuration file. If the
  cache file exists, it just returns the handle of the cache file. Otherwise,
  it will download the file from the `remote` path of the Azure Blob to the
  `cache` file, and then return the handle.

- Open a file to write
  ```python
  from azfuse import File
  with File.open('data/abc.txt', 'w') as fp:
       fp.write('abc')
  ```
  No matter whether there exists a cache file with the same name, it will open the
  cache file. Before it leaves `with`, it will upload the `cache` file to the
  `remote` file in the Azure Blob Storage.

- Pre-cache a bunch of files for processing
  ```python
  from azfuse import File
  File.prepare(['data/{}.txt'.format(i)] for i in range(1000))
  for i in range(1000):
      with File.open('data/{}.txt'.format(i), 'r') as fp:
         content = fp.read()
  ```
  The function of `prepare` will download all files in one azcopy call, which is much faster than download each file sequentially.
  As `prepare()` has already downloaded all the files to the cache folder, there
  will be no azcopy download when calling `File.open()`. 

- Upload the file in an asynchronous way.
  ```python
  from azfuse import File
  with File.async_upload(enabled=True):
     for i in range(1000):
         with File.open('data/{}.txt'.format(i), 'w') as fp:
              fp.write(str(i))
  ```
  A separate subprocess will be launched to upload the cache files. It will
  also upload multiple cache files at the same time in one azcopy call if there are.
  The cache file can also be re-directed to `/dev/shm` such that the file
  writing into cache files will be faster. It is enabled by `File.async_upload(enabled=True, shm_as_tmp=True)`
  In this case, the upload process
  will delete the cache file once it is uploaded.

## Tips
- Safe to read the same file from multiple processes.

  A lock is implemented to make sure there is only one process to launch
  azcopy if the file is not available in `cache`. The other processes will not
  re-launch the azcopy as long as it is ready in `cache`.

- Clear cache if the file is updated on another machines.
  
  For the sake of speed, the tool does not check if the cached file is
  up-to-date. That is, if the file is updated on another machine, the current
  machine's cached file may be out-of-date. In this case, call
  `File.clear_cache(local_path)`. The parameter here is not `cache` path.

- No need to clear cache for writing.
  
  No matter whether there is an existing file in Blob, the writing will always
  overwrite the existing file or creating a new file in Blob

- Patch the function if the `open` is inside some package.

  For example, in the package of [Deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/deepspeed), the `torch.save` is invoked in
  `model_engine.save_checkpoint`. We can patch `torch.save` by the following
  example.
  ```python
  def torch_save_patch(origin_save, obj, f, *args, **kwargs):
      if isinstance(f, str):
          with File.open(f, 'wb') as fp:
              result = origin_save(obj, fp, *args, **kwargs)
      else:
          result = torch.save(obj, f, *args, **kwargs)
      return result
  
  def patch_torch_save():
      old_save = torch.save
      torch.save = lambda *args, **kwargs: torch_save_patch(old_save, *args, **kwargs)
      return old_save
  ```
  With the context of `File.async_upload(enabled=True, shm_as_tmp=True)`, we
  can easily have the feature of asynchronously uploading the checkpoint to Azure
  Blob.

## Command line
A command line tool is provided for some data management.

### setup
   set the following alias to use azfuse as a command line.
   ```
   alias azfuse='ipython --pdb -m azfuse --'
   ```

### usage
- read a `local file`.
  ```
  azfuse cat data/file.tsv
  azfuse head data/file.tsv
  azfuse tail data/file.tsv
  azfuse display data/file.png
  azfuse nvim data/file.txt
  ```
  If you know the `cache file` is out of date, please manually delete the
  cache file and re-run this command.
- list the files under a folder
  ```
  azfuse ls data/sub_folder
  ```
- get the url of a `local file`, which refers to the remote file
  ```
  azfuse url data/file.tsv
  ```
  The SAS token is generated with 30 days expairation date. This is normally
  used for data sharing.
- delete the `remote file`. Please note that this operation cannot be reverted.
  Run it with extreme caution.
  ```
  azfuse rm data/local_path.tsv
  ```
- update a file
  ```
  azfuse update data/file.txt
  ```
  This will launch neovim as default. If the file changes, the changed content
  will be uploaded, and the change cannot be reverted. Thus, please also be careful.
